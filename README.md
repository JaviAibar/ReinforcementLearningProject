# Reinforcement Learning Project

This is the project from the Subject Autonomous Learning I took in the Summer Semester 2020 in Christian-Albrechts-Universit√§t zu Kiel.
With a "player" (Agent) without interaction and a random goal, were in this project some concepts from Reinforcement Learning put to test, 
such as development of different exploration algorithms (Q-Learning, SARSA, Deep Q-Network, etc) and the effect in terms of learning by changing different values

The project was based on the Learning Environment created by DeepMind and in turn based on the acclaimed game StarCraft II providing a rich environment for Artificial Intelligence research
It is composed of an Agent called Marine (following the nomenclature from the original game) who must learn by itself to move around the board in search for the randomly placed goal (The Beacon) 

Note: I am no expert in either Artificial Intelligence nor any of its study areas, therefore may be mistakes all around the project.
      I am not sure to which extent do I have any rights on this project, therefore I will inherit original project's license (Apache-2.0 license). In case there should be another licence, please consider it instead and contact me so I can correct it.
